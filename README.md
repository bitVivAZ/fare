# Fare Website
Fare (fà·re) meaning “to do” in Italian, is a prototype I made using React.

At the moment you are able to add a Todo Card by filling in the Add Todo Card form and clicking on the plus icon. You can then add subtasks to that card by placing the text into the subtask input and pressing enter.

After adding a subtask you can choose to either check the box, edit the title by doubling clicking on the text or delete it by editing the title (double click on text) and removing all characters and pressing enter or hovering over the subtask and clicking on the bin icon.

You are also able to set the Todo Card to complete, making it uneditable and fade away or delete it by clicking on the bin icon.
